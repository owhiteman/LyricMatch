# LyricMatch
Web app that uses the genius.com API to pull four random songs and one random lyric from one of those songs and then it is up to the user to select the correct corresponding song to the lyric.
It was built using ASP.Net Core on Visual Studio for Mac. It mainly uses Javascript to fetch the API's and validate the users answers, C# is also used to generate the song titles that I have stored on Azure Blob storage.
